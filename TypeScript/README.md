## 🔒 Security

### Security Best Practices

- **Private Key Storage**: Private keys are stored locally in `.env` file and never transmitted
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency allows security audits
- **No External Services**: All operations use official Polymarket APIs
- **Read-Only by Default**: Bot only executes trades you explicitly configure
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors through compile-time checks

### Security Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` file to version control
2. **Private Keys**: Use a dedicated trading wallet, not your main wallet
3. **Access Control**: Restrict file permissions on `.env` file (chmod 600)
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly review trade history and positions
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date (`npm audit`)
6. **Code Review**: Review all code changes before deployment

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@example.com instead of using the issue tracker.
